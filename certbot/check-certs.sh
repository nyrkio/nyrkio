# Handle the chicken and egg problem of having to create certificates before
# nginx will run which can't happen unless nginx is running.
#
# Create dummy certificates if no certificates are found, and replace dummy
# certs with real ones. The user is responsible for running this script like
# so,
#
# 1. check-certs.sh (creates dummy certs)
# 2. Start nginx
# 3. check-certs.sh (replaces dummy certs with real ones)
#
# This allows us to avoid rewriting the nginx configuration until the real
# certificates are available.
