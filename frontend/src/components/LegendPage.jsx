          <p>
            Nyrkiö is one of the many names of{" "}
            <span className="nyrkio-accent-dark">Nyyrikki</span>, the ancient
            spirit of hunting of the Finnish and Karelian conifer forests. They
            are the son of Tapio, the king of the forest, and Mielikki the
            protective and kind mother of the forest kingdom. They also have a
            sister, Tellervo - a playful and beautiful young girl, who
            nevertheless is assigned responsibility for cattle and the birds.
          </p>
          <p>
            The forest is a holy place for the Fennic tribes (Hämäläiset,
            Savolaiset, Karjalaiset, Komi and Mari, and of course the Sami). It
            provides food and it provides shelter from warring tribes, or ships
            passing on the sea. It is also where their ancestors are buried. The
            trees and animals all have a spirit of their own, and humans hug the
            trees and even bid them offerings when entering the forest. Or{" "}

            Tapio.

          <p>
            Nyrkiö is known under many names beyond just{" "}
            <span className="nyrkio-accent-dark">Nyyrikki</span>. A Latin
            manuscript uses the variant <em>Nyrckes</em>, which hence can be
            thought of as the international variation of the name. Although in
            most songs Nyyrikki is introduced as the <em>son</em> of Tapio, they
            are sometimes also witnessed to have taken a more feminine corpus
            when interacting with humans. In fact the "kki" ending in the name
            suggests feminine association, while Nyrckes, Nyrkiö and others are
            masculin names. Hence we use{" "}
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they">
              singular they

            <h3>The spirit of hunters</h3>
            <p>
              In the ancient Fenno-Ugric world, each place and thing has its own
              god or spirit: Ukko ylijumala in the sky, Ahti in the water, and
              Tapio with his family members as caretakers of the forest. The
              word <em>haltia</em> is the same as Swedish älva, or Irish/Celtic
              Elfs. However, the word means - or at least rhymes with - the word
              guardian. Hence Tapio is the guardian and king of the entire
              forest, the kingdom of Tapiola.
            </p>
            <p>
              And in that kingdom,{" "}
              <span className="nyrkio-accent-dark">Nyyrikki</span> is assigned
              the caretaker role for small game, in particular the squirrels.
            </p>
            <p>
              While seemingly a lesser task in the family*,{" "}
              <span className="nyrkio-accent-dark">Nyyrikki</span> is known to
              be a loyal and committed guardian spirit, caring well for their
              creatures. And so it was the case, that eventually the small
              squirrels, and particularly their skin, was considered the most
              precious possession a hunter could catch in the forest. (Second
              only to literal gold and silver, the domain of Nyyrikki's mother,
              Mielikki.) So much so that squirrel skins still today is a slang
              word for money, as they were used as an early form of currency
              once upon a time.
            </p>

            <p>
              When entering the forest, a hunter should sing a suitable song**
              or poem, essentially a long form spell, to appease the hunter
              spirit <span className="nyrkio-accent-dark">Nyyrikki</span>.
            </p>
