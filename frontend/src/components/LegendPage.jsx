            <h3>A spirit has many names</h3>
            <p>
              Nyrkiö is one of the many names of <span class="nyrkio-accent-dark">Nyyrikki</span>, the ancient spirit of hunting of the Finnish and Karelian conifer forests. They are the son of Tapio, the king of the forest, and Mielikki the protective and kind mother of the forest kingdom. They also have a sister, Tellervo - a playful and beautiful young girl, who nevertheless is assigned responsibility for cattle and the birds.
            </p>
            <p>The forest is a holy place for the Fennic tribes (Hämäläiset, Savolaiset, Karjalaiset, Komi and Mari, and of course the Sami). It provides food and it provides shelter from warring tribes, or ships passing on the sea. It is also where their ancestors are buried. The trees and animals all have a spirit of their own, and humans hug the trees and even bid them offerings when entering the forest. Or <span class="nyrkio-accent-dark">Tapiola</span> - the reigns of Tapio.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nyrkiö is known under many names beyond just <span class="nyrkio-accent-dark">Nyyrikki</span>. A Latin manuscript uses the variant <em>Nyrckes</em>, which hence can be thought of as the international variation of the name. Although in most songs Nyyrikki is introduced as the <em>son</em> of Tapio, they are sometimes also witnessed to have taken a more feminine corpus when interacting with humans. In fact the "kki" ending in the name suggests feminine association, while Nyrckes, Nyrkiö and others are masculin names. Hence we use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they">singular they</a> as the pronoun when referring to <span class="nyrkio-accent-dark">Nyyrikki</span>. This is of course purely as guidance for our international readers, as <span class="nyrkio-accent-dark">Nyyrikki</span> themselves remains blissfully unaware of gendered pronouns... <a href="https://finland.fi/han/article/">Finnish and Finno-Ugric languages don't have them</a>.

          <h3>The spirit of hunters</h3>
          <p>In the ancient Fenno-Ugric world, each place and thing has its own god or spirit: Ukko ylijumala in the sky, Ahti in the water, and Tapio with his family members as caretakers of the forest. The word <em>haltia</em> is the same as Swedish älva, or Irish/Celtic Elfs. However, the word means - or at least rhymes with - the word guardian. Hence Tapio is the guardian and king of the entire forest, the kingdom of Tapiola.</p>
          <p>And in that kingdom, <span class="nyrkio-accent-dark">Nyyrikki</span> is assigned the caretaker role for small game, in particular the squirrels.</p>
          <p>While seemingly a lesser task in the family*,  <span class="nyrkio-accent-dark">Nyyrikki</span> is known to be a loyal and committed guardian spirit, caring well for their creatures. And so it was the case, that eventually the small squirrels, and particularly their skin, was considered the most precious possession a hunter could catch in the forest. (Second only to literal gold and silver, the domain of Nyyrikki's mother, Mielikki.) So much so that squirrel skins still today is a slang word for money, as they were used as an early form of currency once upon a time.</p>

          <p>When entering the forest, a hunter should sing a suitable song** or poem, essentially a long form spell, to appease the hunter spirit <span class="nyrkio-accent-dark">Nyyrikki</span>.</p>

          <blockquote>
"Nyyrikki, Tapion poika,<br/>
mies puhas, punakypärä!<br/>
Veistä pilkut pitkin maita,<br/>
rastit vaaroihin rakenna,<br/>
jotta tunnen, tuhma, käyä,<br/>
äkkiouto, tien osoan<br/>
etsiessäni ereä,<br/>
antia anellessani! <br/>
<br/>
<em>translation</em>
<br/>
Nyrckes, of Tapio,<br/>
In your red and shining helmet<br/>
Make your arrows show a path<br/>
Find your shelters in the mountain<br/>
So that I can find my ways<br/>
Ignorant as I might be<br/>
Seeking for something wild<br/>
Praying for a generous catch<br/>
          </blockquote>

          <p>When properly summonned, a hunter could then expect <span class="nyrkio-accent-dark">Nyyrikki</span> to reveal a squirrel or some other pray up on a branch.

            <p>The instrument used is a <span class="nyrkio-accent-dark">kantele</span>, a five string harp. In the epic it is used by the powerful sorcerer <strong>Väinämöinen</strong> himself to cast - sing - his spells.</p>
