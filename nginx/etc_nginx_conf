# Depending on the docker base image, it will first have something like
pid /dev/null;
error_log /dev/null;

events {
        worker_connections 768;
        # multi_accept on;
}

# Then comes the http section
http {
    access_log /dev/null;

    # And we're already in it:
    # include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
    include ./nginx.conf.test;

}
